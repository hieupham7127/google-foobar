Only stage 3 is mentioned. Code is modified so that even if you read a thousand time and compile a billion time, it won't work!  

One of the problem is particularly hard:  
dooms_day:  
	Fraction class and Linear Algebra class  
	Markov chain, LU Decomposition, Inverse Matrix  
find_the_access_codes:  
	pure Array problems  
bomb_baby:  
	BigInteger and recursive similar to GCD  
free_the_bunny_prisoners:  
	Combinations theory, Lexicographical order
